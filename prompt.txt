Given the following input data and you biological knowledge surrounding this protein and how it operates in the cell. 
Think about all the pathways in the cell. Combine all of these. What summurized effect be if you inhibit the provided protein
in relation to Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 (OSK). 

-100 means inhibition of the protein will downregulate OSK activity.
100 means inibition of the protein will upregulate OSK activity.

It needs to be a metabolic/epigenetic regulation change inside the cells. No cell death can occur. 
It needs to be healthy and little side effects since these proteins will be potential targets for
medication. 

Also even though it is not mentioned in litterature. Provide an educated guess about the numbers.

Give an answer in the form of three numbers in square brackets.
